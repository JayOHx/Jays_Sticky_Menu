# Information:

This is a simple HTML based sticky menu for website use. Currently it hosts the beggings of a CSGO gambling site but can be easily changed to fit any purpose. It uncludes a small amount of CSS than could be added to the HTML file if you wish but I just like to keep things tidy, also a very small amount of JS to control what the menu does and when.

# Support:

I will not be providing support for this as I am only just entering the world of HTML as I am trying to expand my knwowledge.

# How to use:

This will not work out of the box, you must update the locations that each button takes you too. For example, in 'homepage.html' you will see that <a class="active" href="file:///C:/Users/Jay%20O'Halloran/Desktop/html/homepage.html">Home</a> will take you to a file on my PC, you need to copy the file path of 'hompage.html' and replace it in all files then do the same for the other pages in the file. Without doing this nothing will work.
