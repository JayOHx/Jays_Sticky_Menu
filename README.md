# Information:

This is a simple HTML based sticky menu for website use. Currently it hosts the beggings of a CSGO gambling site but can be easily changed to fit any purpose. It uncludes a small amount of CSS than could be added to the HTML file if you wish but I just like to keep things tidy, also a very small amount of JS to control what the menu does and when.

# Support:

I will not be providing support for this as I am only just entering the world of HTML as I am trying to expand my knwowledge.

# How to use:

a class="active" href="YOUR_NEW_FILE_PATH">Home</a
