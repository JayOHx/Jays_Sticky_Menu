# Information:

This is a simple HTML based sticky menu for website use. Currently it hosts the beggings of a CSGO gambling site but can be easily changed to fit any purpose. It uncludes a small amount of CSS than could be added to the HTML file if you wish but I just like to keep things tidy, also a very small amount of JS to control what the menu does and when.

# Support:

I will not be providing support for this as I am only just entering the world of HTML as I am trying to expand my knwowledge.

# How to use:
1. Change the file paths in each of the .html files, there is 5 paths in each file that need changing.
2. Ensure you're pages match, for example, ensure that you're 'home' path links to the actual homepage.html in all 5 files.
3. Do the same for the other 4 paths to the other pages in all files.
4. Finally, update how you like by changing colors or what ever else.

#Example:

a class="active" href="YOUR_NEW_FILE_PATH">Home</a

-- Don't forget to include < and > at each end of this line above otherwise it won't work.
